## About Reynolds Number Calculator

This calculator calculates the Reynolds Number using the provided flow characteristics. Depending on the flow regime, the calculator informs whether it is one or another.

### Reynolds number in a nutshell

This number tells us what type of flow is expected for a given pipe, whether _laminar_, _transitional_ or _turbulent_.

By convention, there is an approximate number of Reynolds where the limits of some regimes are defined. In systems whose Re is **less** than **2000** there is **no turbulence**. This non-turbulent regime is called _laminar flow_. Systems whose Re is **greater** than **2000** are **turbulent**.
