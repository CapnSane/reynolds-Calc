## About Reynolds Number Calculator

This calculator calculates the Reynolds Number using the provided flow characteristics. Depending on the flow regime, the calculator informs whether it is one or another.

### Reynolds number in a nutshell

This number tells us what type of flow is expected for a given pipe, whether _laminar_, _transitional_ or _turbulent_.

By convention, there is an approximate number of Reynolds where the limits of some regimes are defined. In systems whose Re is **less** than **2000** there is **no turbulence**. This non-turbulent regime is called _laminar flow_. Systems whose Re is **greater** than **2000** are **turbulent**.

#### Units of measurement

For now, I have implemented the conversion of some units of measurement. They are:

- Free-stream fluid velocity, _V_
  - m/s
  - cm/s
  - mph
  - km/h
  - ft/s
  - in/s
  - km/s
    <br>
- Characteristic distance (or pipe diameter), _L_
  - m
  - cm
  - mm
  - &micro;m
  - nm
  - ft
  - in
    <br>
- Fluid density, _&rho;_
  - kg/m³
  - kg/l
  - g/mm³
  - lb/in³
    <br>
- Fluid viscosity (dynamic), _&eta;_
  - Pa⋅s
  - mPa⋅s
  - cP
  - kg/m⋅s
  - slug/ft⋅s
